# üè† Smart Home Automation System using Arduino

This project implements a Smart Home Automation System using Arduino, integrating various sensors and actuators to enhance household **convenience, safety, and energy efficiency**. It automates lighting based on occupancy, protects clothes from rain, and alerts residents in case of fire or gas leakage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Occupancy-Based Lighting**  
  Automatically turns ON/OFF lights based on people entering and exiting the room using ultrasonic sensors.

- **Rain Detection with Clothesline Control**  
  Retracts the terrace clothesline using a servo motor when rain is detected.

- **Flame and Fire Detection**  
  Detects fire and triggers a fast-beeping buzzer alarm, along with a visual alert on the LCD.

- **Gas Leak Detection**  
  Monitors air quality using an MQ-135 sensor and sounds an alert if gas levels exceed a calibrated threshold.

- **User Interface with LCD**  
  Displays welcome/goodbye messages, live people count, system status, and hazard alerts.

- **Buzzer Alerts**  
  Different tones and patterns for rain, gas, and fire alerts.
